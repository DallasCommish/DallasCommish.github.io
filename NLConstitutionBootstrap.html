            <p>
                To assemble a lineup of 28 National League baseball players

            play with fewer teams, be sure to make necessary adjustments so that you
            acquire approximately 80% of all available players at your auction draft. You
            could have a six-team league using National League players, for example, and
            draft only from among your seven favorite NL teams. Unless you reduce the
            available player pool proportionately to reflect a reduced number of teams,
            you'll never learn to appreciate the value of a good bench.</p>

            <p>A teams's active roster consists of the following players:</p>
            
            <p>
                Five outfielders, two catchers, one second baseman, one
                shortstop, one middle infielder (either second baseman or shortstop), 
                one first baseman, one third baseman, one corner man (either first 
                baseman or third baseman), three utility players (one of whom may play 
                any position including pitcher), and eleven pitchers.</p>

                    baseman), one utility player (who may play any position including pitcher), and
                    nine pitchers.</p>
        
            <p>
                <span class="font-weight-bold">2019 AMENDMENT</span>: 
                The addition of two bench players (batters only) and two pitchers were added
                to form the 28 players on the active roster.

            <p>
                <span class="font-weight-bold">2013 AMENDMENT</span>: 
                With the reduction to 24 players, the additional pitcher is
                dropped. The result is a team can have nine or ten pitchers complemented by one
                or zero utility hitters. 
                <span class="font-weight-bold">2016 Clarification</span>: 
                Since the active roster size was reduced from 25 to 24 players, the 
                2014 Amendment is written incorrectly. It should state:

                in which teams may nominate players for acquisition. The team bidding first

                position the player will fill. The process is repeated, with successive team

                    there will be a four-round first-year player draft (FYPD). Eligible 
                    players were drafted the previous summer and were signed during the 
                    international signing period. Players selected in this draft will

                    status will not change until they are activated by a rotisserie 
                    team or spend twenty-one consecutive days on an active, major

                    second reserve roster draft will commence. There will be a maximum 
                    of seven rounds for this draft. Players selected will have salaries 
                    of $15, $10, $5, $5, $2, $2, $2 and their contract status will 
                    be “2”. There will be a time limit of sixty minutes on this draft.
            </p>
            <p>
                    On the second Tuesday following the date of the auction, a final 
                    reserve roster draft will commence. Players chosen in this draft 
                    will have salaries of $5 and their contract status will be “2”.

                    period end date and the commencement of this draft are ineligible 
                    (FAAB has precedence). Owners should submit a list of at least 
                    twelve players before this draft begins. Owners will be notified if 
                    their list becomes exhausted. This draft will end at the conclusion 
                    of the current period. Each team will be allowed to select players 
                    to fill their reserve roster – that means teams should expect to 
                    have four openings, but some teams could have a different number 
                    due to trades involving draft picks or open slots from the FYPD.

            <p>
                A Player may be assigned to any position at which he appeared in
                20 or more games in the preceding season. If a player did not appear in 20
                games at a single position, he may be drafted only at the position at which he
                appeared most frequently. The 20 games/most games measure is used only to
                determine the position(s) at which a player may be drafted. Once the season is
                under way (but after Auction Draft Day), a player becomes eligible for
                assignment to any position at which he has appeared at least once. Players
                selected for the utility slot may qualify at any position.

                means of release or is signed to a guaranteed long-term contract.

            <ul class="list-group">
             <li class="list-group-item">Composite batting average (BA)</li>

                Teams are ranked from first to last in each of the eight
                categories and given points for each place. For example, in a 12-team league,
                the first-place team in a category receives 12 points, the second-place team
                11, and so on down to 1 point for last place. The team with the most total
                points wins the pennant.

            <p>
                <span class="font-weight-bold">THE FENOKEE IP REQUIREMENT.</span> 
                A team must pitch a total of 1000 innings to receive points in ERA and 
                ratio. A team that does not pitch 1000 innings maintains its place in 
                ERA and ratio ranking but receives one point in both of these categories 
                with all teams below shifting up one point. (Thus, a team that finished 
                third in ERA but did not have 1000 IP would receive one point in that 
                category. The fourth-place team in ERA would now receive 10 points.) 
                This rule was passed in 1988 in response to an &quot;all-relief&quot;
                strategy attempted by the Okrent Fenokees in the 1987 season. The strategy was
                not successful because Swampmaster Dan Okrent abandoned it after six weeks or
                so. But it might have worked, in more disciplined hands. Hence the new rule.

            <p>
                <span class="font-weight-bold">THE FENOKEE AB REQUIREMENT.</span>
                A team must have 4250 at bats in the season. A team that does not have 
                4250 at bats maintains its place in the batting average ranking but 
                receives one point in that category with all teams below shifting up 
                one point. This rule was passed in 1991 in response to an 
                &quot;all-pitching&quot; strategy attempted by the Okrent Fenokees in 1990.
                This time, the Beloved Founder and Former Commissioner-for-Life assembled an
                all-star pitching staff, Tony Gwynn, and 13 Ken Oberkfells (i.e., guys who
                didn't play enough to bring down Gwynn's &quot;team&quot; BA). The BFFCL hoped
                to amass 40 pitching points, 10 BA points, and 3 points in the other offensive
                categories to squeeze into the first division. The strategy was not successful
                because the Swampmaster abandoned it after six weeks or so. But it might have
                worked, in more disciplined hands. Hence the new rule.

            <p>
                Here's how it works. Let's say you drafted Neon Deion Sanders of the 
                Atlanta Braves for $2 in 1992, a fair price then for a football player
                with a strikeout swing, a questionable attitude, and too much jewelry. 
                It's now the spring of 1994 and Sanders, whose maturity has caught up 
                with his raw talent, has become a power threat and a team player. You 
                could let Sanders play one more season for you and get a tremendous 
                return on your two dollars, but that would be almost as foolish as 
                Sanders risking his knees in the NFL. Taking a longer view, you 
                daydream about Sanders's power and speed numbers, assess your needs, 
                project what's likely to be available in the upcoming draft, cross your 
                fingers against football injury -- and sign him to a three-year guaranteed
                contract. Sander's salary zooms to $12 ($2 + $5 + $5), but he's yours
                through the 1996 season. His signing bonus, which does not count against your
                $260 Auction Draft Day limit, is $18 (one half of 3 X $12). If he 
                continues to mature as a ballplayer, you've got a bargain.

                who have concluded their option year or the last year of a guaranteed 
                long-term contract. This group of players becomes the winter roster.

            <p>
                The Rotisserie League is governed by a Committee of the Whole consisting 
                of all team owners. The Committee of the Whole may designate as many
                league officials as from time to time it deems appropriate, although 
                only two -- the League Secretary and the League Treasurer -- ever do 
                any work. The Committee of the Whole also designates annually an 
                Executive Committee composed of three team owners in good standing. The 
                Executive Committee has the authority to interpret playing rules and to 
                handle all necessary and routine League business. All decisions, 
                rulings, and interpretations by the Executive Committee are subject to 
                veto by the Committee of the Whole. Rule changes, pronouncements, and 
                acts of whimsy are determined by majority vote of the Committee of the 
                Whole. Member leagues of the <span class="font-weight-bold">Rotisserie 
                League Baseball Association</span> may appeal to the RLBA for 
                adjudication of disputes and interpretation of rules. The Rotisserie 
                League has three official meetings each year: Auction Draft Day (the 
                first weekend after Opening Day), the Midsummer Trade Meeting (at the 
                All-Star break), and the Gala Postseason Banquet and Awards Ceremony. 
                Failure to attend at least two official meetings is punishable by trade
