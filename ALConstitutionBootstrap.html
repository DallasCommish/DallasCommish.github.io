                We, the People of the Rotisserie League, in order to spin a more
                perfect game, drive Justice home, kiss domestic Tranquility good-bye, promote
                the general Welfare in Tidewater -- where it's been tearing up the
                International League -- and secure the Blessings of Puberty to ourselves and
                those we've left on Base, do ordain and establish this Constitution for
                Rotisserie League Baseball, and also finish this run-on sentence.

            <p>
                To assemble a lineup of 24 American League baseball players
                whose cumulative statistics during the regular season, compiled and 
                measured by the methods described in these rules, exceed those of all 
                other teams in the League.

            <h4 class="text-info">TEAMS</h4>
              
            <p>There are 12 teams in a duly constituted Rotisserie League
              composed of American League players.</p>

                <!--
                If you choose to play with fewer teams, be sure to make necessary 
                adjustments so that you acquire approximately 80% of all available 
                players at your auction draft. You could have a six-team league using 
                American League players, for example, and draft only from among your 
                seven favorite AL teams. Unless you reduce the available player pool 
                proportionately to reflect a reduced number of teams, you'll never 
                learn to appreciate the value of a good bench. -->
                The league objective is to acquire approximately 80% of the players on 
                MLB rosters. This has been the historical goal and allows flexibility 
                as MLB roster sizes change and the number of league owners changes.

                Five outfielders, two catchers, one second baseman, one shortstop, one

                baseman, one third baseman, one corner man (either first baseman or third
                baseman), a minimum of nine pitchers, and two utility players (which

                With the advent of inter-league play in 1997, the designated hitter 
                will be re-classified as a utility player and can be any player

                With the move of Houston to the American League, rosters are expanded 
                to 24 players with the addition of one additional utility player. The 
                result is a team can have nine, ten or eleven pitchers complemented by two,
                one, or zero utility hitters.

                general agreement determines the order in which teams may nominate 
                players for acquisition. The team bidding first opens with a minimum 
                salary bid of $1 for any eligible plaayer, and the bidding proceeds 
                around the room at minimum increments of $1 until only one bidder is

                Draft selections will take place online in public view of the

                to complete the draft before the beginning of the annual

            <p>Teams are ranked from first to last in each of the ten
            categories and given points for each place. For example, in a 12-team league,
            the first-place team in a category receives 12 points, the second-place team
            11, and so on down to 1 point for last place. The team with the most total

                <span class="font-weight-bold">THE FENOKEE IP REQUIREMENT.</span>
                A team must pitch a total of 900 innings to receive points in ERA and 
                ratio. A team that does not pitch 900 innings maintains its place in 
                ERA and ratio ranking but receives one point in both of these 
                categories with all teams below shifting up one point. (Thus, a team that
                finished third in ERA but did not have 900 IP would receive no points in that
                category. The fourth-place team in ERA would now receive 10 points.) This rule
                was passed in 1988 in response to an &quot;all-relief&quot; strategy attempted
                by the Okrent Fenokees in the 1987 season. The strategy was not successful
                because Swampmaster Dan Okrent abandoned it after six weeks or so. But it might
                have worked, in more disciplined hands. Hence the new rule.

                4250 at bats maintains its place in the batting average ranking but 
                receives one point in that category with all teams below shifting up 
                one point. This rule was passed in 1991 in response to an 
                &quot;all-pitching&quot; strategy attempted by the Okrent Fenokees in 
                1990. This time, the Beloved Founder and Former Commissioner-for-Life 
                assembled an all-star pitching staff, Tony Gwynn, and 13 Ken Oberkfells 
                (i.e., guys who didn't play enough to bring down Gwynn's 
                &quot;team&quot; BA). The BFFCL hoped to amass 40 pitching points, 10 
                BA points, and 3 points in the other offensive categories to squeeze 
                into the first division. The strategy was not successful because the

                any day of the week. Since the Commissioner and Statistician was taking 
                Master's level classes at night while working full-time, noon Central on

                <span class="font-weight-bold">NOTE ON DUMPING:</span>
                &quot;Dumping&quot; is the inelegant but scientifically precise term 
                used to descibe what happens when a team out of contention gives up on 
                the season and trades to a contending team its most expensive talent and
                its players who will be lost to free agency at the end of the year, typically
                for inexpensive players who can be kept the following season. A
                &quot;dumping&quot; trade is always unbalanced, sometimes egregiously so, 
                with the contending team giving up far less than it gets, and the 
                noncontending team giving up much more in order to acquire a nucleus 
                for the following season. While this strategy makes sense for both 
                clubs, extreme cases can potentially undermine the results of the 
                auction draft, which should always be the primary indicator of an 
                owner's ability to put together a successful team.
            </p>
              
            <p>
                To guard against this, we have in the past employed rigid and 
                restrictive Anti-Dumping measures to control trades between contenders 
                and noncontenders. But in light of major shifts in international 
                politics and economics in recent years, we decided in 1993 that these 
                restrictive measures tended in inhibit rather than enhance the playing 
                of the game.
            </p>
              
            <p>
                Accordingly, we swept away all Anti-Dumping legislation in 1993. We did 
                so with some trepidation, but we felt the benefits of a free market 
                would outweigh the potential for abuses. We were right. Let freedom ring.

                A team's reserve roster consists of seven players with any status: on
                an active roster, on the IL, or in the minor leagues. Players on the
                reserve roster can be waived, subject to the usual long-term 
                contract rules.

                To replace such a player, a Rotisserie League team must first release 
                him outright or place him on its reserve list. A team reserves a player
                by notifying the League Secretary and paying the $1 transaction fee. A 
                reserved player is removed from the team's active roster at the end of 
                the stat week (on Sunday) -- when formal notification is given -- and 
                placed on the team's reserve list. There is no limit to the number of 
                players a team may have on its reserve list. Reserving a player 
                protects a team's rights to that player.

                jewelry. It's now the spring of 1994 and Sanders, whose maturity has 
                caught up with his raw talent, has become a power threat and a team 
                player. You could let Sanders play one more season for you and get a 
                tremendous return on your two dollars, but that would be almost as 
                foolish as Sanders risking his knees in the NFL. Taking a longer view, 
                you daydream about Sanders's power and speed numbers, assess your needs, 
                project what's likely to be available in the upcoming draft, cross your 
                fingers against football injury -- and sign him to a three-year 
                guaranteed contract. Sander's salary zooms to $12 ($2 + $5 + $5), but 
                he's yours through the 1996 season. His signing bonus, which does not 
                count against your $260 Auction Draft Day limit, is $18 (one half of 3 
                X $12). If he continues to mature as a ballplayer, you've got a bargain.

                The Rotisserie League is governed by a Committee of the Whole consisting 
                of all team owners. The Committee of the Whole may designate as many
                league officials as from time to time it deems appropriate, although 
                only two -- the League Secretary and the League Treasurer -- ever do any 
                work. The Committee of the Whole also designates annually an Executive 
                Committee composed of three team owners in good standing. The Executive 
                Committee has the authority to interpret playing rules and to handle all 
                necessary and routine League business. All decisions, rulings, and 
                interpretations by the Executive Committee are subject to veto by the 
                Committee of the Whole. Rule changes, pronouncements, and acts of 
                whimsy are determined by majority vote of the Committee of the Whole. 
                Member leagues of the <span class="font-weight-bold">Rotisserie League
                Baseball Association</span> may appeal to the RLBA for adjudication of
                disputes and interpretation of rules. The Rotisserie League has three 
                official meetings each year: Auction Draft Day (the first weekend after 
                Opening Day), the Midsummer Trade Meeting (at the All-Star break), and 
                the Gala Postseason Banquet and Awards Ceremony. Failure to attend at 
                least two official meetings is punishable by trade to the 
                Cleveland Indians.
